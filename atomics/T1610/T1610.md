# T1610 - Docker Deploy Into Container
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)
<blockquote>Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment.(Citation: Docker Daemon CLI)
